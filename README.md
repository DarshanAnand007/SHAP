# Diabetes Prediction Model with Explainable AI Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on various health indicators. It includes the integration of SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to provide insights into the model's predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is 'dia.csv', containing information about pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and diabetes outcome.

## Building the Classifier

### Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP

### Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Model
- Utilized a Random Forest Classifier for the prediction.
- Hyperparameters: 
  - max_features = 2
  - n_estimators = 100
  - bootstrap = True

### Evaluation
- Evaluated the model using classification report metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

## Integrating Explainability Layer with SHAP

### SHAP Installation
- Installed SHAP library using pip.

### Explainability Process
- Created a TreeExplainer for the trained Random Forest Classifier.
- Generated SHAP values to explain feature importance and model predictions.

### Visualization
- Visualized global variable importance using summary plots.
- Visualized summary plots for specific labels.

## Results

### Model Performance
- Precision: 0.87 (class 0), 0.62 (class 1)
- Recall: 0.81 (class 0), 0.72 (class 1)
- F1-score: 0.84 (class 0), 0.67 (class 1)
- Accuracy: 0.78

### Explainability Insights
- The model primarily relies on glucose levels, BMI, and diabetes pedigree function for predictions.
- Glucose levels have the highest impact on predicting diabetes.

## Conclusion

The integration of SHAP with the Random Forest Classifier provides valuable insights into the model's predictions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness. Further optimization and fine-tuning can be explored to improve model performance and interpretability.
